# Code for applying and evaluating results of population analyses used in the paper 

Main scripts are:

PCA_CrossVal_SingleBrReg.m - applies PCA on population activity of a selected brain region, decomposes projections into contributions from TF responsive and TF non-responsive units 

MovNullAnalysisCrossVal_SingleBrReg.m - performs the mapping of population activity of a selected brain region into movement and movement-null subspaces

MovNullAnalysisCrossVal_BrainWide_Step1.m and MovNullAnalysisCrossVal_BrainWide_Step2AndPlotResults.m - performs the same analysis for each brain region in the dataset and generates summary plots across brain regions
