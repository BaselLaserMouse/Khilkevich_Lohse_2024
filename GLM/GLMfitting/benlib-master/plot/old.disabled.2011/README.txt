This directory contains all my general-purpose utility functions.  There's not
much interesting here, but this directory will need to be in your path if you
want to run anything else of mine.

Notable:

subplotbw.m -- better subplot
applytodir.m and qapplytodir -- apply function to every file in directory
show*.m -- variety of display routines for different shaped data
