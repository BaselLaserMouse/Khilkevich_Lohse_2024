function [h,T] = bdendrogram(Z,p,rawdata,cutoff)
%DENDROGRAM Generate dendrogram plot.
%   DENDROGRAM(Z) generates a dendrogram from the output matrix of
%   LINKAGE.  Z is a (M-1) by 3 matrix. M is the number of
%   observations in the original data. 
%
%   A dendrogram consists of many upsidedown U shape lines connecting
%   nodes in a hierarchical tree. Except for the WARD linkage (see
%   LINKAGE), the height of each U is the distance between the two
%   clusters to be connected at that time.  
%
%   DENDROGRAM(Z,P) generate a dendrogram with only the top P nodes.
%   When there are more than 30 nodes in the original data, the
%   dendrogram may look crowded. The default value of P is 30. If P =
%   0, then, every node will be displayed.
%
%   H = DENDROGRAM(...) returns a vector of line handles.
%
%   [H, T] = DENDROGRAM(...) also returns T, a vector of size M that
%   contains cluster number for each observation in the original data.
%
%   When bottom leaves are cutoff, some information are lost. T
%   supplies this lost information. For example, to find out which
%   observations are contained in node k of the dendrogram, use
%   FIND(T==k). 
%
%   When there are less than P observations in the original data, T
%   is the identical map, i.e. T = (1:M)'. Each node only contains
%   itself.
