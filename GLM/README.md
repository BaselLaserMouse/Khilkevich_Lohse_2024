## GLMs for Khilkevich and Lohse et al., 2024, Nature

Code for building, fitting and predicting NPX recorded neural activity from behavioural and stimulus events in the task used in Khilkevich and Lohse et al., 2024, Nature.

EventGLM_AllSubmodels_WrapperAllSessionsandCells.m and NaiveEventGLM_AllSubmodels_WrapperAllSessionsandCells.m are the top level scripts (wrappers) of the code from which the the Poisson GLMs used in the paper are build and fitted
